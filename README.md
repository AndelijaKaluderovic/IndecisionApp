## Indecision App

If you have a lot to do and have no idea where to start, this is a perfect app for you. Add all todos and let "somebody else" (a computer algorithm) make a decision for you. This is a fun way to decrease the stress in daily decision making, but also for me as a creator, this project helped me reiforce my knowledge of class components and webpack.
